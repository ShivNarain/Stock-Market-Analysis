    "- 1: Install beautifulsoup 4 library.\n",
    "- 2: Import all the necessary libraries: requests and re.\n",
    "- 3: Open file 'stocks.csv' in write mode.\n",
    "- 4: Using the requests lib get the url for scrapping: https://money.cnn.com/data/hotstocks/\n",
    "- 5: Using beautifulsoup library , scrap the page using html.parser.\n",
    "- 6: Extract ticker symbol and company name from parsed page and store it in dictionary.\n",
    "- 7: Under each title, get the company information for each ticker symbol using loop.\n",
    "- 8: Call function 'data_scrap' with ticker symbol as its argument.\n",
    "- 9: 'data_scrap' function will scrape data from website https://in.finance.yahoo.com/quote/ as in step 4 and step 5.       It will return three values.\n",
    "- 10: Write company name, ticker symbol, open price, previous close and volume in csv file. \n",
    "- 11: Close the file after writing all the values.\n",
    "- 12: Ask user to enter one ticker symbol from the list.\n",
    "- 13: If entered ticker symbol is found in the csv file, print the information of the company and finish the program.\n",
    "- 14: Else, ask user to enter valid ticker symbol.\n",
